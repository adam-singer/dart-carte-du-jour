Introduction
--

dart-carte-du-jour is the source code behind [www.dartdocs.org](http://www.dartdocs.org). Technology preview. Have a feature request? Send it over to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/financeCoding/dart-carte-du-jour/issues/new). This project is still evolving and looking for contributors to help. 

Configuration settings
--

Configuration settings for project and google related services are stored on 
cloud storage as a plain json file. Upon startup of `daemon-isolate` the
`config.json` file is copied to the compute engine instance. 

```
gsutil cat gs://dart-carte-du-jour/configurations/config.json
{
  "projectId":"dart-carte-du-jour",
  "projectNumber":"00000000001",
  "serviceAccountEmail":"00000000001-xyz@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "rsaPrivateKey":"bin/rsa_private_key.pem",
  "sdkPath":"/dart-sdk"
}
```

The other configuration that is copied from cloud storage is `rsa_private_key.pem` file.
`rsa_private_key.pem` is the key file for google api services called from dart. 

```
gsutil ls gs://dart-carte-du-jour/configurations/rsa_private_key.pem
```

Starting and stopping documentation service
--

Only authorized users are able to start and stop the `daemon-isolate`

Starting the `daemon-isolate`

```shell 
cd dart-carte-du-jour/scripts/daemon_launch
./launch-instance.sh
```

Stopping the `daemon-isolate`

```shell 
cd dart-carte-du-jour/scripts/daemon_launch
./kill-instance.sh
```

Monitoring
--

Authorized users can check if the `daemon-isolate` is still alive and all
isolates have not bailed out by running the following script. 

```shell
cd dart-carte-du-jour/scripts/daemon_launch
source daemon-isolate-functions.sh && carte_remote_health_checks
```

output:

```
daemon_isolate.dart - everything is ok
daemon_isolate_gce_launcher.dart - everything is ok
daemon_isolate_build_index.dart - everything is ok
daemon_isolate_build_package_validation.dart -everything is ok
daemon_isolate_queue.dart - everything is ok
```

Sending commands to daemon-isolate service
---

*daemon-isolate* service runs multiple isolates. Each isolate can receive 
commands over `http://localhost:<isolate_port>`. One `isolate_port` is open for
each isolate.
